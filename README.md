# Warehouse-website

Warehouse is a website that helps students registered in the Arab Academy for Science and technology, college of Logistics. According to their final semester they are required to submit a graduation project so, they came with an idea of mixing two majors which are warehousing and E-commerce, They need a website to collects all the warehouses over Egypt- for now is just Alexandria- that are free and available for people to store in their goods and raw materials. This website will enhance the both topics mentioned before here in Egypt.
